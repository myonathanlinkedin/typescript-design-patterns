# Cp Algorithms - Data Structures & Competitive Programming Core (TypeScript)

> A clean, dependency-free **TypeScript** reference implementation of **Cp Algorithms - Data Structures & Competitive Programming Core**, focused on core algorithmic mechanics, clear memory layout, and test verification.

## Overview & Mechanics

The implementation focuses on the core mathematical properties of **Cp Algorithms - Data Structures & Competitive Programming Core**:
* **Data Organization**: Built upon `Standard Memory Primitives` to ensure predictable traversal and storage overhead.
* **Safety Invariants**: Zero external heap dependencies; designed as a pure in-memory algorithmic component.
* **Execution Guarantees**: State consistency is verified after mutations through assertion test coverage.

## Complexity Profile

* **Time Complexity**:
  * Fast Path (Best): `O(1)`
  * Generalized (Avg / Worst): `O(N)`
* **Space Footprint**: `O(N)` resident heap / stack overhead.

## Verification & Test Scenarios

The test suite in `main.ts` validates:
* Standard operational paths against expected outcomes.
* Extreme values and edge inputs to ensure robust failure handling.
* State stability across sequential and repeated operations.

```bash
# Execute local verification runner
npx ts-node main.ts
```
