# Faster Planar Graph Algorithms for Connectivity Problems via Meanders

A clean, dependency-free **TypeScript** reference implementation of **Faster Planar Graph Algorithms for Connectivity Problems via Meanders**, focused on core algorithmic mechanics, clear memory layout, and test verification.

### Core Highlights
* **Language & Standard**: Modern `TypeScript` standard library conventions.
* **Architecture Pattern**: Designed for `Graph Topology & Traversal` using `Adjacency List & Priority Heap`.
* **Runtime Overhead**: Memory allocations are kept minimal to maintain clear data locality and predictable memory bounds.
* **Concurrency & Safety**: State transitions follow clear ordering guarantees with explicit validation at each phase.

### Complexity Analysis

| Dimension | Bound |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Time (Best Case)** | `O(V + E)` |
| **Time (Worst Case)** | `O(V^2)` |
| **Auxiliary Space** | `O(V + E)` |

### Test Suite Execution

Self-contained verification drivers are embedded directly in `main.ts` to validate happy paths, boundary inputs, and invariant preservation.

```bash
npx ts-node main.ts
```
