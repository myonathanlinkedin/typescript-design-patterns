# Type-Safe Matrix Transformation and Reduction Engine (TypeScript)

> An in-memory reference implementation of **Type-Safe Matrix Transformation and Reduction Engine** in **TypeScript**, adhering to standard library idioms, clean data structures, and assertion test suites.

## Overview & Mechanics

The implementation focuses on the core mathematical properties of **Type-Safe Matrix Transformation and Reduction Engine**:
* **Data Organization**: Built upon `Lookup Tables & Bitwise Bitvectors` to ensure predictable traversal and storage overhead.
* **Safety Invariants**: Contiguous memory layouts and standard collections are favored for straightforward iteration and access.
* **Execution Guarantees**: Execution behavior is validated against nominal workflows and boundary edge cases.

## Complexity Profile

* **Time Complexity**:
  * Fast Path (Best): `O(N log N)`
  * Generalized (Avg / Worst): `O(N log N)`
* **Space Footprint**: `O(N)` resident heap / stack overhead.

## Verification & Test Scenarios

The test suite in `main.ts` validates:
* Standard operational paths against expected outcomes.
* Extreme values and edge inputs to ensure robust failure handling.
* State stability across sequential and repeated operations.

```bash
# Execute local verification runner
npx ts-node main.ts
```
